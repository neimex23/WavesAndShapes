# Waves and Shapes

**Waves and Shapes** is an **open-source Unity project** created for **self-learning game development**, inspired by the rhythm-based bullet hell mechanics of *Just Shapes & Beats* by **Berzerk Studio**.

## üéØ Project Goals
- **Explore and learn Unity** through practical, hands-on development.
- **Create a story-driven experience** that blends intense gameplay with music-driven levels.
- **Develop bullet hell mechanics**, where player movement and survival depend on rhythm and timing.
- **Design dynamic boss patterns** that synchronize with custom soundtracks.
- Build a foundation for a **community-driven, open-source project** where others can contribute ideas, code, and assets.

## ‚ú® Inspiration
This project takes heavy inspiration from the unique and visually stunning design of *Just Shapes & Beats* by **Berzerk Studio**, focusing on:
- Fast-paced bullet hell gameplay.
- Music-synchronized attack patterns.
- Minimalist shapes and vibrant visual effects.

## üöÄ Current Progress
The project currently includes:
- A basic **player controller** with movement and rotation (inspired by vector-based controls).
- Early prototypes for dash and parry mechanics.
- Initial design concepts for music-synced enemy attacks.

## üîÆ Future Plans
- **Dash and parry mechanics** that let the player block or evade attacks in rhythm.
- **Boss battle sequences** synchronized with custom songs.
- **Story mode** with progressive difficulty and narrative elements.
- **Level editor** for community-created stages and challenges.
- **Improved visual effects** and shaders to enhance the bullet hell experience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Open Unity Hub** and add the project folder.
3. Use **Unity 6.1 or later** (as the project is being developed on this version).
4. Open the main scene in the Unity Editor and press **Play** to test the current prototype.

## ü§ù Contributing
This is an open-source and collaborative learning project. Contributions are welcome! Whether you're interested in coding, music composition, visual design, or storytelling, feel free to fork the repository and experiment.
